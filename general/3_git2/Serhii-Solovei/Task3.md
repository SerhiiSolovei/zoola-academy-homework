	##Task 3: Use your imagination
To be honest, from the very beginning I was afraid of the last task. 
When I read in ZoolaAcademy how happy Diana was about answer on this task one of student. 
Almost in the end I accidentally made some mistake and create last task for me. 
I never was so happy about my mistakes :)
Maybe that's not so good example and solution of this problem, but anyway.

I keep all screenshots inside of this directory => 
S@V580 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/zoola-academy/homework/HW 3 GIT/test-repo-HW-GIT/screenshots-HW-GIT 

I didn't merge changes after first task, I want to do it all together in end.
So I push changes in that branch after first task (task-0) and want to do it also after (task-1).
When I did it, I didn't check in which directory I'm working.
S@V580 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/zoola-academy/homework/HW 3 GIT/test-repo-HW-GIT 
I was in that step and put by hand screenshots from 'Desktop' to that directory.
Then I switch the branch, make commit and push. 
$git checkout Serhii-Solovei-HW-GIT => $git add . => 
$git commit -m "Add screenshots for task-1" => git push origin Serhii-Solovei-HW-GIT

In GitHub I understand that push screenshots in wrong dir.
I revert last commit using command $git revert

Then I understand that don't have these screenshots anywhere, I delete them..
I made 'revert' for 'revert' and in local machine move files to correct directory and push changes.

Everything was okay in local, but in GitHub repo it was doublicate of these files. (add screenshots)
I find solution to press on file link which I need to delete => press to trash can => "Commit changes".

I add all screenshots in repo https://github.com/SerhiiSolovei/test-repo-for-GIT-HW
